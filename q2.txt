Q2.a) 8 trees

Q2.b) The rule NP → NP PP | Det N makes the tree continually expand,
      because the first word in the default sentence will continually going into
      the recursion of NP -> NP and will never reach the verb

      The rule  NP → Det N | NP PP parses the first two words in the default
      sentence into NP and next reaches the verb. It is an adequate solution for
      the default since it can successfully parse the sentence.
